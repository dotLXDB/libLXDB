# libLXDB

LXDB is my database project that i'm making for learning C++

It is not intended for it to become production ready but i don't exclude possibility

It is planned for DB to work on REST API directly from engine without SQL

This library will be needed for db to work, will be automatically managed by client/server with auto-updates

To use .lxdb files in your project to store data you won't need to use C functions as i will make wrappers for common languages such as Rust and C#

For "production" environments please wait for server and client packages
